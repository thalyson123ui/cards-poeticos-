				<p>
					A lone watchtower stands by the moaning shore,<br>
					Its shadow long, though eyes watch no more.<br>
					Salt-kissed winds whisper secrets of the sea,<br>
					But no soul stirs in its silent decree.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once it scanned the horizon, steadfast and proud,<br>
					Now only gulls cry beneath gathering cloud.<br>
					Rust etches poems in its weathered face,<br>
					Time’s fingerprints left in every trace.
				</p>

				<p>
					The tide comes and goes with a lover’s ache,<br>
					Touching its base, then gently breaks.<br>
					It dreams in creaks and the scent of brine,<br>
					Of voices lost in the strands of time.
				</p>

				<p>
					Yet still it stands, as dusk turns to night,<br>
					A sentinel steeped in fading light—<br>
					Lonely, yes, but never quite bare,<br>
					For the sea and stars still know it's there.
				</p>

				<p> The forest sleeps beneath a shroud of grey,<br>
					Where dawn forgets to find its way.<br>
					Each branch is cloaked in silver breath,<br>
					Suspended still, in quiet death.
				</p>
				<p> No bird dares break the woven hush,<br>
					No footstep stirs the softened brush.<br>
					Only the mist moves, slow and thin,<br>
					Like ghostly fingers drawing in.</p>
				<p> Moss clings tight to oaken skin,<br>
					Guarding secrets held within.<br>
					And somewhere deep, beyond the veil,<br>
					Old echoes ride the morning pale.
				</p>
				<p> A place of dreams, or things once lost,<br>
					Where time forgets and paths are crossed.<br>
					The forest waits with breath held tight—<br>
					A world between the dark and light.

			<h2>The Pineapple in the Field</h2>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>
					There once was a pineapple, proud and round,<br>
					Who somehow sprouted in farming ground.<br>
					Among the wheat and rows of corn,<br>
					He stood confused, alone, forlorn.
				</p>
				<p> The carrots laughed, “You’re not from here!”<br>
					The turnips jeered, “Go disappear!”<br>
					But Pineapple puffed his leafy crown,<br> And said, “I’m tropic royalty, calm down.” </p>
				<p> He tried to blend with grassy flair,<br> But sunburned cows just stopped to stare.<br> A scarecrow waved in silent cheer,<br> The only friend who came too near. </p>
				<p> Then came the rain, a soggy squall,<br> And Pineapple held his ground through all.<br> The field soon saw, with sweet surprise,<br> He kept the pests from eating pies. </p>
				<p> Now every crop from kale to pea,<br> Tips their roots respectfully.<br> The lesson clear, as farmers yield:<br> Don’t judge a fruit by where it’s fielded. </p>
